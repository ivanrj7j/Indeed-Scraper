A day in the life You wake up and either get on the Amazon shuttle or use your free Amazon provided bus pass to commute to the office in the morning, though if you have an early meeting (8 am) you sometimes choose to take it from home, and then commute into the office later. Once you arrive, you grab a drink from the lobby. Today you choose cold brew, but your office also has free drip coffee, espresso, kombucha, and tea. Now that you are well caffeinated, you are ready to start your day. You get into the office and say hello to your coworkers before sitting down at your desk. You check your slack messages and emails to make sure there isn’t anything urgent. Product has a question regarding implementation details on your current project so you decide to resolve the discussion in person since you think that will be faster. You get up from your seat and look over the dividers in the aisle to begin the discussion and are able to resolve it in five mins. (If this was not an in-office day, you would have just as easily spun up a quick Chime call or Slack huddle.) After that, you join the team’s daily “sync up” to discuss progress from the prior day, what you are working on today, and any help needed. You then have an uninterrupted two-hour block for coding till your next meeting. You finish this block feeling super productive. You then sit down to have lunch in the office cafeteria with some of your team members and your partner team members. Every other Tuesday though you instead join the official team lunch and joke around with your team members. After lunch, you need some help with the build system and post in the team slack room. The team quickly jumps in, and you get unblocked within 10 minutes. You’re happy that your team is responsive and collaborative. You then join a meeting with Product to discuss a new feature you are building. You both collaborate on a solution that you think will be best for your customers. You take notes and send out the action items after the meeting. You spend a few more hours coding and then realize its already 3 pm. You remember that your child has an appointment at 4:30 pm, so you head home to pick them up from day care, letting the team know you will make up the hours later in the night or early tomorrow morning since you didn’t want to use vacation/personal time. About the team Team Culture : The team environment is inclusive, supportive, and collaborative. We build our culture through quarterly team events, monthly team lunches, understanding each other’s strengths and growth areas (so that we know how to leverage each other when needed), and working as a team, not individuals, to meet our goals.

Position Announcement We enthusiastically invite interdisciplinary researchers to apply to join our newly established Department of Data Science as a tenure-track faculty colleague, to begin in fall 2025. We invite applications from researchers working in Data Science, broadly defined, including those working in other domains who contribute to data analysis methodology for that domain (e.g., methods and/or applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistical inference, computational/applied mathematics, data visualization, etc) as well as those whose research focuses directly on the methodology itself (e.g., computer science or statistics). We are building the Data Science department to center justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion (JDEI), in our department's research, teaching, and organization. Strong faculty candidates will therefore have demonstrated impactful contributions to JDEI. We encourage applications from candidates with a history of collaboration with domain experts. Strong candidates will have excellent research scholarship; as befits an inclusive, interdisciplinary department, we are open to various metrics of research success beyond grants, citations, and publications (including policy impact, community engagement in research, collaborative projects, et cetera). Strong candidates will also have demonstrated excellence in and commitment to teaching, translation of knowledge, or advising/mentoring of students (including out-of-classroom education). We are excited to grow a mutually supportive culture of impactful teaching and research in our new department. We seek candidates who are enthusiastic to help develop our department culture of inclusive excellence, and have demonstrated this through past service. We welcome candidates who understand the barriers facing members of groups who have been historically excluded from data science and higher education (as evidenced by life experiences and educational background), and who have experience in JDEI with respect to teaching, mentoring, research, outreach, life experiences, or service towards building an equitable and diverse scholarly environment. More information about the Data Science department can be found at https://scds.uoregon.edu/ds. Particular strengths of collaborative research at UO include astronomy, biomedical data science, cell and developmental biology, data ethics, earth science, ecology, education, environmental science, evolution, linguistics, neuroscience, physics, spatial information sciences and sport and wellness, although we welcome applicants from other disciplines. Department or Program Summary Data Science is a new department that has grown out of a long-standing initiative to increase scholarship and education in quantitative methodology at the University of Oregon. We envision the Data Science Department to be a hub of ethical methodological data science research, with strong connections to domain areas of application, overall facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration across the university. Current faculty and affiliates reflect strengths in machine learning, biological modeling, data ethics, data sovereignty, computer science, environmental data science, climate change policy and modeling, evolutionary genetics, and forensic genetics. The University of Oregon is a public university committed to exceptional teaching, discovery, and service, with a mission to foster the next generation of transformational leaders and informed participants in the global community. The department offers a rapidly growing Data Science undergraduate program, offered for the first time in Fall 2020 and projected to have >700 undergraduate majors in 2027. This program aims to help students learn the technical data science skills to do socially/environmentally-connected interdisciplinary work with real world impact. Faculty in the department of Data Science can work with PhD students and integrate in specialized research communities through affiliations with world-class research Institutes on campus (e.g., the Institute of Neuroscience; the Institute of Ecology and Evolution; Center for the Study of Women in Society). Junior faculty in Data Science will be supported through the transition to tenure, including reduced service expectations, access to training in teaching through the Teaching Engagement Program, and faculty mentors to support building a research program. The Data Science department invests in the success of each new member and seeks to support faculty in successful and impactful careers while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Minimum Requirements PhD at the time of appointment in a discipline related to data science (ex: statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, or a domain field with strong involvement in data science methodology applied in that field).
